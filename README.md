## Overview

The immediate goal is to create a smart and simple addon manager for World of Warcraft. It shall be robust when it needs to be but yet smart enough to keep your addons up-to-date.

The domain logic shall not be coupled to the user interface framework. While the initial design is in WPF, the goal should be a cross-platform framework that does not only provision releases for the Windows OS.

## Framework

- .NET Core 3.1 SDK
- Windows Presentation Framework (WPF)

## Tooling

- Visual Studio 2019 with 3.1.x .NET Core support
- VS Code
- Rider probably too
